            <h4>This project was motivated by Ruha Benjamin's ideas and key concepts expressed in her book, <i>Race After Technology.</i> Her book criticizes the amplification of racial biases (and even the creation of new ones) which comes as a result of succumbing to exponential technological "advancement."<strong> Advancement for who?</strong> She refers to our present-day predicament, being under the shackles of a rapidly modernizing world, as the "New Jim Code," in which inequity is proliferated and even synthesized under the guise of promoting progressivism with the use of new technologies [4 -- Benjamin 5]. </h4>
            <h4>Yet, Benjamin's stance towards technology is not exclusively pessimistic. She cites applications that were developed specifcially to combat an oppressive phantom of technology, such as Appolition: an app that rounds up your purchases to the nearest dollar, and gives your loose change to a "network of organizations that post bail for those who can't afford it themselves." [5]</h4>
            <h4>This project aims to capture the positive and negative effects that come from platforms such as Twitter being so popular; through interacting with this application, one can determine (at least on a small scale): do people use platforms like Twitter to voice harmful rhetoric, or opinions that promote social solidarity? </h4>
            <h4>There are two intended audiences for this project: people who live in areas where social justice is rarely discussed or frowned upon, and surprisingly, programmers & algorithm designers. I resonate with both of these audiences, as I grew up in an area where topics like racism were very rarely discussed, and when they were discussed, they were always approached with a tone-deaf and dismissive attitude; I am also an avid programmer, and I have seen firsthand how we tend to exercise a one-dimensional view upon programming and algorithmic design -- the social impacts of technology are rarely considered, as we are hyperfocused on what algorithms do, rather than their side effects, and who they ultimately serve.</h4>
            <h4>I seek to prove that while technology can certainly exacerbate preexisting racial biases, and create new ones, there are steps that we (programmers) can take to circumvent hateful algorithmic design. This project attempts to employ technology in a more unconventional way, when compared to online social spaces. Arguably a Foucauldian idea, I am attempting to capitalize on "surveillance" by using it to point out the effects of technology, in the realm of social justice conversations [6 -- Foucault 18].</h4>
